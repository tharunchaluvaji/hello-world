# hello-world

Good Morning!

I am Tharun. This is my first Github Repository
Nice to meet you all!!

On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. 
Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. 
Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. 
When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. 
Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. 
The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

Created an open source repository
Started and managed a new branch
Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
Opened and merged a Pull Request


Good Luck!
